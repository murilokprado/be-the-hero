# Be The Hero
Project Be the hero an application for NOGs (non-governmental organizations) to raise funds.

Be the hero is the __OmniStack Week #11__ :rocket: project, creating a project with backend, frontend and mobile using __NodeJS__, __React__ and __React Native__ stack.

## Backend :scroll:
To build backend it was used [express router](https://expressjs.com/pt-br/guide/routing.html) to management routes of application. To validate requests, it was used [Joi validation](https://github.com/arb/celebrate) of celebrate. To persist and get data it was used [knexjs](http://knexjs.org/) with __SQLite__.

I used [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/download/) to test requests. You can find my insomnia.json [here](/backend/insomnia.json).

To did unit test and integration test it was used [jest](https://jestjs.io/)

`npx knex migrate:latest`

Then we can startup the application

`npm start`

The application will be run on http://localhost:3333.

#### Tests

To execute our test we need to run 

`npm test`

return should be

```
PASS  tests/unit/generateUniqueId.spec.js
PASS  tests/integration/ong.spec.js

Test Suites: 2 passed, 2 total
Tests:       2 passed, 2 total
Snapshots:   0 total
Time:        2.704s

```

## Frontend :computer:

### Running
First for frontend works, We'll need backend running on `http://localhost:3333` because axios will try to call this path.

Whit this done run 

`npm install`

After that

`npm start`

## Mobile :iphone:

### Running
As in frontend, here We'll need a backend running, but you'll need vonfig your backend IP on file [api.js](/mobile/src/services/api.js).
This case my backend it was running on ___http://192.168.0.4:3333___ , you may to replace baseURL with your IP.

```
import axios from 'axios';

const api = axios.create({
  baseURL: 'http://192.168.0.4:3333'
})

export default api;
```
After that you run

`npm install`

Finish We can start the mobile application with command

`expo start`

### Running on device
You should be download the expo app on your device.

- [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent&hl=pt_BR)
- [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/br/app/expo-client/id982107779).

On page generated by expo command previously, there is a QRCODE, you can use your device to scan that code and that's all folks.
