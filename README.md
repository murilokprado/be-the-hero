# Be The Hero
Project Be the hero an application for NOGs (non-governmental organizations) to raise funds.

Be the hero is the __OmniStack Week #11__ :rocket: project, creating a project with backend, frontend and mobile using __NodeJS__, __React__ and __React Native__ stack.

## Backend :scroll:
To build backend it was used [express router](https://expressjs.com/pt-br/guide/routing.html) to management routes of application. To validate requests, it was used [Joi validation](https://github.com/arb/celebrate) of celebrate. To persist and get data it was used [knexjs](http://knexjs.org/) with __SQLite__.

I used [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/download/) to test requests. You can find my insomnia.json [here](/backend/insomnia.json).

To did unit test and integration test it was used [jest](https://jestjs.io/)

### Features
- Register and Login :heavy_check_mark:
- Create, delete and list of incidents :heavy_check_mark:
- Create and get nogs :heavy_check_mark:

### Running
First enter on backend project

`cd backend`

After, run:

`npm install`

On first time running the application we need run a npx command to apply migrations

`npx knex migrate:latest`

Then we can startup the application

`npm start`

The application will be run on http://localhost:3333.

#### Tests

To execute our test we need to run 

`npm test`

And then the return should be look like this:

```console
PASS  tests/unit/generateUniqueId.spec.js
PASS  tests/integration/ong.spec.js

Test Suites: 2 passed, 2 total
Tests:       2 passed, 2 total
Snapshots:   0 total
Time:        2.704s
Ran all test suites.
```

## Frontend :computer:
To build frontend it was used [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) to http requests and to management routers it was used react-router-dom

### Features
- Register NOGs :heavy_check_mark:
- Login :heavy_check_mark:
- New incidents :heavy_check_mark:
- Profile listing incidents :heavy_check_mark:

### Running
First for frontend works, We'll need backend running on `http://localhost:3333` because axios will try to call this path.

Whit this done run 

`npm install`

After that

`npm start`

## Mobile :iphone:
As in frontend, mobile application builded using [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios).

### Features
- List of incidents :heavy_check_mark:
- Detail of incidents :heavy_check_mark:
- Email send :heavy_check_mark:
- Whatsapp message :heavy_check_mark:

### Running
As in frontend, here We'll need a backend running, but you'll need vonfig your backend IP on file [api.js](/mobile/src/services/api.js).
This case my backend it was running on ___http://192.168.0.4:3333___ , you may to replace baseURL with your IP.

```javascript
import axios from 'axios';

const api = axios.create({
  baseURL: 'http://192.168.0.4:3333'
})

export default api;
```
After that, you run

`npm install`

Finish we can start the mobile application with command

`expo start`

### Running on device
You should be download the expo app on your device.

- [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent&hl=pt_BR)
- [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/br/app/expo-client/id982107779)

On page generated by expo command previously, there is a __QRCode__, you can use your device to scan that code and that's all folks.
